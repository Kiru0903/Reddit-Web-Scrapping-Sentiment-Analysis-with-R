However, Ive checked consistently for 5 weeks and no updates have been given as to when my items will even arrive. Nothing has changed since November 5th, when my items shipped with Canada Post.

"As you guys might have heard that the yellow jacket gets discolored in the rain or any contact with water. I have some things to say. I noticed that for the care tag inside the jacket, it says that to cleanù it, it has to be washed, and immediately put on tumble dry with tennis balls.

 Now, my theory is this jacket really isn't meant for water, which is why it looks like it's stained when it's wet and which is the reason to why it must be dried immediately. I also noticed on pictures that the dye or colors do lightly change a bit, which is something you guys should know. 

Lastly, not only this, but majority of yellow puffers or lightly colored puffers have the same issue, because of the feathers inside it being wet, I guess it leads to the jacket looking like it had stained. I have went through grailed for the yellow jackets and seen lots of the yellow jackets generally look darker than what it looks like it's new. Anyways, these were my thoughts, feel free to share yours!
